# Fall-Detected
Fall Detected System Using YOLOv8
---
## Overview
**Fall-Detected** is a Python-based project that integrates real-time video processing for detecting falls. The system is designed to capture live video feeds, analyze them, and detect fall events, potentially useful in elderly care or safety monitoring applications.

## Features
- **Real-time Video Feed**: Streams live video for continuous monitoring.
- **Fall Detection**: Uses machine learning techniques to detect fall events in real-time.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a simple web interface to display the live video feed.
